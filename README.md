Test your javascript knowledge with this timed quiz - with a (local) scoreboard!

In this project I have created a timed quiz to help practice similar coding quizzes that are given in job applications. 

New concepts that I am demonstrating are DOM manipualtion and the use of localStorage and JSON to store data.
